                <p> In part 1, we reviewed the working principles of quantum computers and the problem of quantum error correction (QEC), where researchers are forced to come up with new ways to account for corrupted qubits as classical methods fail. 
<br><br></p>

                <p>
In classical error correction, the most common error is a bit flip, when 0 becomes 1 and 1 becomes 0. Even though the probability of a bit flip is small, it is high enough to cause serious damage to information systems. To combat this, systems will encode the bit by sending multiple copies of it, usually 3. Specifically, 0 would be sent as 000 and 1 would be sent as 111. In this way, if one bit is corrupted, the other two remain the same and the receiving end can tell that there was an error. 
  <br><br>
                </p>
                <p>
For example, if the sender wants to send 0, they will encode it as 000 and send it off. Let’s say that the middle bit is flipped, so the message becomes 010. However, 2 out of the 3 bits are still 0, so by majority vote, the receiver correctly concludes that the original message was 0. If the probability of an error happening without correction is x (x is a small number, like 1% or 0.01), the probability of an error happening with correction actually shrinks to x2 (for instance, 0.012 = 0.0001, a huge improvement!). 
              <br><br></p>
                <p>
In quantum systems, qubits can be 0, 1, or any state in between (superposition). In addition, qubits are subject to two types of error: bit flips and phase flips. Similar methods are used to account for these, although with key differences. The annotated circuit diagram below demonstrates a three-bit code for error correction. It is nearly the same as the classical bit flip procedure, but modified to fit the outline of quantum mechanics. 
                <br><br></p>
                <p>
<strong>A)</strong> |𝜓〉 represents the qubit we want to send, which is either 1, 0, or any state in between. Since it is a qubit, the exact state |𝜓〉 is in remains a mystery. If we try to read it, it will collapse to either 0 or 1 and lose whatever it had in between.                 <br><br></p>
               <p>
Note: |𝜓〉 is in “Dirac notation”, where the Greek letter psi (𝜓) is sandwiched between the two symbols | and 〉. This notation is used to denote quantum wavefunctions like qubits, since they are distinguished from classical bits. 
                <br><br></p>
                <p>
<strong>B)</strong> |𝜓〉 is sent with two qubits of known value: |0〉.
                <br><br></p>
                <p>
<strong>C)</strong> The qubits pass through two controlled-NOT or CNOT gates, which are operations that entangle the |0〉 qubits with |𝜓〉. Entanglement is the quantum mechanical version of copying a bit. In this way, even though we don’t know what the value of |𝜓〉 is, the |0〉 qubits have changed to hold essentially the same value. 
                <br><br></p>
                <p>
<strong>D)</strong> The qubits may undergo error or corruption.
                <br><br></p>
                <p>
<strong>E-H)</strong> E, F, G and H comprise a circuit that checks whether any qubits have changed. It does this by individually comparing |𝜓〉 to each |0〉, and then comparing those two comparisons. For example, if one of the |0〉 qubits from B changes to become |1〉, then through the CNOT gates, one of the |0〉 qubits from E will also change to reflect that. 
                <br><br></p>
                 <p>
<strong>I)</strong> Assuming there was only one error maximum, the system will be able to decode |𝜓〉. However, if more than one error happens, this circuit would fail. In fact, the classical bit code would also fail; for example, if you send 0 as 000 but two errors happen (maybe 101 or 011), then the receiver will assume that since 2 out of the 3 bits are now 1, the original message was 1. The same thing happens with this quantum circuit. 
                <br><br></p>
                 <p>
Of course, the three-bit code is a simplified generalization of error correction, and real systems implement more complex and interconnected failsafes to account for higher likelihood of error. 
              <br><br></p>           
                <p>In part 3, we’ll learn about how Google has been revolutionizing the field of error correction by using many, many more qubits while balancing the error margins those qubits are subject to. See you then!</p>
